This is a playful project I used while reading through Google Gemini’s API documentation pages. The objective is to try create simple interfaces for some of Gemini’s API calls using Go and the Cobra CLI framework. The benefit of this is that users can craft their prompts and plug them in using more flexible scripting languages such as Bash and Python.Over time I hope to share usage examples on this repo.
